# Field Guide Challenge — Build & Facilitation Pack

Companion to the app in this repo. The **app is the engine** (it gates the codes and sends crews into the Let Grow app); this doc is the human side: what to build in Let Grow, the trainer scripts, the plant wall, the physical setup, and the answer key.

**Client:** Liberty Utilities (LUC), central Missouri ROW · **Delivery:** conference icebreaker, ~100 people, 10 teams of 8–10, all at once, 15–25 min, expect ~50% to sit out.

---

## 1. The app

- Live: `https://growwithtrees.github.io/LUC-GAME-FieldChallenge-DEV/` · one page per team slug, opened by that team's QR code (no picker).
- Teams are plain **numbers**, 1 to 10. No name can collide with a puzzle answer, and every plant stays free for the wall.
- Six stops, each a real Let Grow feature. Enter the code the app gives you, unlock the next stop. Finish → a 2-digit **fragment**; two same-color teams combine fragments into a 4-digit box combo.

| Team | Slug | Box | Fragment | Trainer | Reply word |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Team 1 | `/team-1` | Red | 47 | Hannah | `CORRIDOR` |
| Team 2 | `/team-2` | Red | 12 | Hannah | `COMPATIBLE` |
| Team 3 | `/team-3` | Green | 58 | Hannah | `SELECTIVE` |
| Team 4 | `/team-4` | Green | 36 | Hannah | `CLEARANCE` |
| Team 5 | `/team-5` | Blue | 29 | Hannah | `FOLIAR` |
| Team 6 | `/team-6` | Blue | 64 | Hannah | `BASAL` |
| Team 7 | `/team-7` | Amber | 81 | Hannah | `FLASHOVER` |
| Team 8 | `/team-8` | Amber | 53 | Hannah | `CONDUCTOR` |
| Team 9 | `/team-9` | Purple | 70 | Hannah | `SAPLING` |
| Team 10 | `/team-10` | Purple | 26 | Hannah | `ENCROACH` |

**Box combos:** Red `4712` · Green `5836` · Blue `2964` · Amber `8153` · Purple `7026`.

**Team count does not depend on headcount.** All 10 pages are built. Hand the QR cards out **in colour pairs** — if the room only makes 7 or 8 teams, drop whole pairs (e.g. skip Purple and Amber) so every box still has exactly two teams. Anya's headcount only changes how many people stand behind each QR.

Fragment order within a pair is the table order (first team's number goes first).

---

## 2. The six stops (content + answer)

1. **Messages** — team opens Messages, finds their trainer, sends `TEAM <n> CHECKING IN` (e.g. `TEAM 3 CHECKING IN`); trainer replies their word. **Answer = the trainer's word.**
2. **Field Guide / Search** — clue only (low compatible shrub, coral-pink berry clusters, heavy deer browse). Search the field guide to name it. **Answer = `CORALBERRY`** (`BUCKBRUSH` and `INDIAN CURRANT` also accepted).
   > **CONFIRMED loaded — plant ids 143 (WZC-BZS) and 455 (WZS-BZS), filed as “Coralberry.”** Note LUC's own 26-species compatible list and the shipped *Ozark Buckbrush vs Multiflora Rose* Field Bite both call it **Buckbrush**, so crews may type the name their own training taught them. Both accepted; the facilitator should not correct anyone who says buckbrush.
3. **Plant Identify / Scan** — on the plant wall, find the shrub that grows **with its feet in the water** and carries a **creamy white pincushion flowerhead** (buttonbush), scan it, open its entry, read its **max height**. **Answer = `12`** (`144` also accepted as a safety net). Reads real entry data, no planted code — see [design note](#7-design-notes).
   > **CONFIRMED loaded — plant ids 75 (WZD-BZS) and 380 (LET_GROW), *Cephalanthus occidentalis*, max height `144`.** The database stores inches; the learner app runs it through `inchToFeet()` and renders **feet + inches**, so the entry reads **12 ft 0 in**. The answer is therefore `12`, as written.
4. **Field Clips** — play **“What’s the Tree.”** Johnny reads one tree part by part (2:06, vertical) and **never names it**, on screen or in audio. The team names it from the field marks. **Answer = `CALLERY PEAR`** (`BRADFORD PEAR` and bare `PEAR` also accepted).
   > **The published title must not contain the species.** Mike cut a dedicated version for this, `2026.09.14 Treeline - What's the Tree.mp4` — publish that one, not the original `…Botany In A Blink - Callery Pear.mp4`, whose filename gives the answer away. The in-app clue says **“What’s the Tree,”** so keep that phrase in the Field Clips title.
5. **ChatTrain** — reassure landowner **Mrs. Webb** about spraying; pass the beat for the phrase. **Answer = `COMPATIBLE COVER`.**
6. **Field Bites** — complete the microlearning *What Makes a Plant Compatible?*; enter the keyword it ends on. **Answer = `BIOLOGICAL CONTROL`.** The keyword only appears once all three knowledge checks are answered, so the stop cannot be skipped by swiping to the last card.

## 3. Trainer cards (print one per trainer)

**One trainer: Hannah.** All ten teams message the same person, so there is nothing to staff and nothing to brief beyond one card. Each team still gets its **own** reply word, and the team's name is right there in the message they send, so Hannah just reads the name and looks up the row.

**Hannah's card (print the table from §1 on the back):**
> **Teams will message you `TEAM 1 CHECKING IN`, `TEAM 2 CHECKING IN` and so on.** Read the number, find it on your card, reply with **that team's one word** and nothing else. Ten teams, ten messages. Wrong message? Reply: *"Say again — send me your team name and CHECKING IN."*
>
> `TEAM 1`→CORRIDOR · `TEAM 2`→COMPATIBLE · `TEAM 3`→SELECTIVE · `TEAM 4`→CLEARANCE · `TEAM 5`→FOLIAR · `TEAM 6`→BASAL · `TEAM 7`→FLASHOVER · `TEAM 8`→CONDUCTOR · `TEAM 9`→SAPLING · `TEAM 10`→ENCROACH

**Every reply word is a single word on purpose** — an earlier draft had WIRE ZONE / BORDER ZONE / LOW GROWING, and a space in Hannah's reply would have failed the match. The matcher is now spacing-tolerant either way, but keep the words single. Per-team words are what stop one team shouting the answer across the room. **If ten lookups under pressure turns out to be too much on the day, the fallback is one shared word for everybody** — set every `word` in `app.js` to the same string and reprint the card. Swapping Hannah for Lindsey is a one-line find-and-replace in `app.js`.

> **Confirmed (Mike, 14 Sep): participants can message other people in the app**, so stop 1 works as designed. Hannah just needs to be watching her inbox during the icebreaker.

## 4. Content to build in Let Grow (admin)

| Stop | Feature | Build |
|---|---|---|
| 2, 3 | Plantdex | **BOTH CONFIRMED LOADED, no build needed.** Coralberry (ids 143/455) and Buttonbush (ids 75/380, 144 in = **12 ft**). Verified against the exported LUC plant list, `GWT/GWT Let Grow/PlantDex/LUC plant list .csv` + `2023.06.01 Let Grow Plant List.csv`. **Each is duplicated** under two ids/growth zones (and id 380 is `"Buttonbush "` with a trailing space) — harmless here, since both buttonbush rows carry the same 144 and stop 2 only needs the name, but expect two hits in search. |
| 4 | Field Clips | **CUT AND FILED** — `2026.09.14 Treeline - What's the Tree.mp4` (93 MB, 2:06, 608×1080, in `LUC Training/Environmental Tailgates/2025 Johnny videos/!Completed/`). Verified on the export: no species name in the audio, no opening title card, lower-thirds are trait labels only (LEAF / SMELL / …), generic *Botany In A Blink* outro. **Publish under a title containing “What’s the Tree”** to match the in-app clue. |
| 5 | ChatTrain | The **Mrs. Webb** flow (spec below). |
| 6 | Field Bites | **BUILT AND IN A REPO** — *What Makes a Plant Compatible?* (`luc-what-makes-a-plant-compatible`), `growwithtrees/LUC-LG-FB-CompatibleSpecies-DEV` (private). Still has to be **loaded into Field Bites in the app**. |

**Footnote on the clip, for non-game use.** Johnny *did* record a reveal — `November Videos/Johnny Voice Audio/callery pear pt 3.mp3`: *"What do you think it is? …this is Callery pear. A problem tree, invasive… obviously this can't grow in the line… I take it out."* It was cut from the published 2:10 edit. For the escape room that cut is what makes the stop work, so leave it out. If a straight training version is ever wanted, that audio is the ending.

### ChatTrain — "Mrs. Webb — the spraying question" (single beat)
- **Persona:** Mrs. Webb, a landowner. Concerned, not hostile. (Approved LUC persona surname.)
- **Opening (Mrs. Webb):** *"I saw your crew out there spraying by my fence. Are you killing everything? I've got some good brush the deer use — I don't want it gone."*
- **Score these behaviors (not vocabulary):** (1) reassures her the crew is **selective**, not clearing everything; (2) names that the target is **tall incompatible trees** near the lines, not her low shrubs; (3) affirms the **compatible / wildlife plants (coralberry) stay**.
- **Fail-1/2 coaching** if she isn't reassured (dismissive or over-technical) — brief redirect from the coach.
- **Eval / reveal on pass:** *"That makes me feel a lot better. Thank you for explaining."* → shows **Pass phrase: COMPATIBLE COVER**.
- **Prompt lengths** per house rule: roleplay ~30–50 words, coaching ~50–80, eval ~120–150.

## 5. The plant wall

**Nine sheets, one plant each.** Sheet 1 is buttonbush's flowerhead because that is what stop 3's
clue describes; every other sheet is a **close-up leaf**, which is what a plant-ID app reads most
reliably off paper, several isolated on white. **Pages match the photo's orientation** so each print
is as big as letter allows.

**Tested in the app 15 Sep — it identified every sheet**, with one wrinkle: roughleaf dogwood
(sheet 3) often comes back as **red osier dogwood**. Harmless. Red osier is a wet-site shrub so a
team might try it for stop 3, but its entry reads **120 in / 10 ft**, so the game rejects the answer
and sends them back. Elderberry is the only decoy that passes silently.

- **Buttonbush** — the scan target, sheet 1: the **creamy white pincushion flowerhead** the clue names. (Max height 12 ft in its entry.) A second buttonbush leaf sheet was dropped once the app proved it reads the flowerhead fine — one sheet per plant.
- **Coralberry / Buckbrush** — the field-guide (search) answer. Filed in the app as **Coralberry**.
- Other compatibles as near-misses: **Blackberry**, **Roughleaf dogwood** (both on LUC's compatible list).
- Incompatible trees a crew controls: **Callery pear** (the Field Clip answer — it must be on the wall), **Eastern redcedar**, **Black locust**, **Tree of heaven**.
  > **Osage orange was dropped.** Every osage image in the library is the same dormant bud-and-thorn macro — no leaf, no foliage, nothing an app can identify. Tree of heaven replaced it: a higher-value ROW invasive with a clean leaf-and-samara shot isolated on white. Sweetgum was dropped too; there is no image for it at all.
- **Elderberry** — compatible near-miss, on the wall as of 15 Sep. Teams are numbered now, so no plant name is reserved.
  > **Know the hazard.** Elderberry's Plantdex entry is a clone of buttonbush's on every field stop 3 reads — same growth zone (WZD-BZS), same Opposite branching, same MEDIUM growth speed, **same 144 in / 12 ft max height**, same extra info. They differ only in name, Latin name and family. A team that scans elderberry instead of buttonbush therefore gets the right answer for the wrong reason, invisibly. That is why stop 3's clue leads on the **creamy white pincushion flowerhead** — which nothing else on the wall has — rather than on wet ground alone, since elderberry is also a moist-site shrub.
  > **Seven plants on LUC's list sit at 144 in** (False Indigo Bush, Elderberry, Hazelnut, Glossy Buckthorn, Japanese Knotweed, Mountain Pepperbush, Buttonbush). **Check any new wall plant against that list before it goes up.**
- Team names are numbers, so nothing on the wall can be mistaken for a team's own name.

One shared wall serves all 10 teams (they photograph images, not each other).

## 6. Finale, physical setup, roles

- **Five combo-lock prize boxes**, one per colour, for a full ten-team room. Two same-colour teams combine their fragments into the 4-digit combo — set the locks to `4712` (Red), `5836` (Green), `2964` (Blue), `8153` (Amber), `7026` (Purple), or change the fragments in `app.js` to match locks you already own. Fewer teams = fewer boxes; drop whole colours. Prize inside (buttons / stickers / candy).
- **Roles (print one card per team):** Scanner (drives the app), Scribe (runs the screen), Navigator (reads the clues) — forces ≥2 people hands-on.
- **On-site setup, target ≤30 min:** tape up the plant wall · set 10 team QR cards on tables · set the boxes with combo locks + prizes · hand Hannah her reply-word card. All Let Grow content + all printing is done ahead.

---

## 7. Design notes

- **Stop 3 reads real content, not a planted code.** Entries are all structured the same, so a hidden keyword is gameable; filtering by a trait then reading a real field (buttonbush height) tests the actual skill and needs no admin change.
- **No hints.** Directions say exactly what to do; a wrong answer just shakes with a plain retry. (See the `feedback_interactive_build_design` memory.)

## 8. Answer key (facilitator cheat sheet)

| Stop | Feature | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Messages | Hannah's per-team word (see §1 table) |
| 2 | Field Guide / Search | `CORALBERRY` (app name) / `BUCKBRUSH` (LUC's name) — both accepted |
| 3 | Plant Identify / Scan | `12` (buttonbush max height) |
| 4 | Field Clips | `CALLERY PEAR` (or `BRADFORD PEAR`) |
| 5 | ChatTrain | `COMPATIBLE COVER` |
| 6 | Field Bites | `BIOLOGICAL CONTROL` |
| — | Finale | fragment → 4-digit box combo (Red 4712, Green 5836, Blue 2964, Amber 8153, Purple 7026) |

### Open items before the event

**In the app — nothing here is blocked:**
1. **Upload `2026.09.14 Treeline - What's the Tree.mp4` to Field Clips**, titled to contain **“What’s the Tree.”** Not the original Callery Pear file — the video never names the tree, so the listing title is the only thing that can kill this stop.
2. Have **Hannah watching her Messages inbox** during the icebreaker, reply-word card in hand.

**On us:**
3. **Load the Field Bite into Field Bites in the app.** Repo is live: `growwithtrees/LUC-LG-FB-CompatibleSpecies-DEV` (private, like every other FB repo). Ship it as a **package**, not a paste — `./make-package.sh` builds the zip, and the app truncates pasted HTML at ~64 KB while this deck is ~60 KB standalone / 1.7 MB packaged.
4. **Print:** 10 team QR cards (against the `growwithtrees.github.io` URL), the plant wall, Hannah's reply-word card, role cards.
5. **Buy:** five combo locks + boxes; prizes. Poison-ivy soap and similar practical items were floated on the 8 Sep call.
6. Callery pear **must** be on the wall (stop 4's answer). Buttonbush is the scan target — read the elderberry note in §5 before adding any other wet-site shrub.

**Nothing is blocked on a Liberty answer any more.** Everything above is ours to do.

**Closed:** ~~trainer names~~ (Hannah, all teams) · ~~can a participant message a trainer?~~ (yes, 14 Sep) · ~~redcedar clip must be shot~~ (Callery pear clip exists, verified it never names the tree) · ~~team count waits on headcount~~ (10 pages, handed out in colour pairs) · ~~are the plants in Plantdex?~~ (Coralberry 143/455 · Buttonbush 75/380 at 144 in = 12 ft) · ~~Mrs. Webb ChatTrain~~ (trainer 62, `https://chattrain.org/play/252ffb2cf73a`) · ~~Field Bite keyword~~ (`BIOLOGICAL CONTROL`).
